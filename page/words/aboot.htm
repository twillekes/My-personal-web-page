<h3>The Photographer</h3>
<p>
I'm an amateur photographer that enjoys taking pictures around my home town of Calgary, Alberta.
Since I am an amateur, I am not available for hire.
But I am receptive to requests; if interested I will take on projects at no fee.
For example I'd be happy to take pictures of your old homestead for posterity.

My photographs are <b>not</b> available for commercial usage. Private usage may be permitted at no fee, please contact me if you are interested in using one of my images.
</p>
<p>
If you would like a print of one of my images please contact me. I do not sell prints of my photographs but may print a copy for you if you cover any printing and shipping expenses up front.

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>
Make the mundane magnificent.
</p>
<h3>Prime Directive</h3>
<p>
Only take photographs; only leave footprints.
</p>
<h3>Technical</h3>
<p>
I use a variety of cameras to capture the images on these pages. I use film media to record the images because I enjoy the process. Most images on these pages are captured on medium or large format film.
</p>
<p>
I have favored Fuji Velvia transparency (slide) film in the past but am now moving to usage of Fuji Provia film exclusively. I find the extreme color saturation of Velvia is no longer what I am after; instead I seek a saturated but more realistic rendering. For black and white images I utilize Ilford Delta 100 and occasionally some good old-fashioned Kodak Tri-x.
</p>
<p>
After obtaining the film based images, I select those that I deem of sufficient quality for display on my web page and scan them. Editing is done with Photoshop but only the most basic of manipulations are performed. This usually involves traditional "dodge" and "burn" operations along with some color correction to ensure the image accurately reflects what my eyes observed at the time. I purposefully avoid extensive manipulation as a matter of personal preference.
</p>
<p>
Since many of my images are captured of scenes that have dynamic range well beyond what slide film can capture, I usually utilize in-camera techniques to compress dynamic range. That is, I use graduated neutral density filters - as much as 5 stops worth at times.
</p>
<p>
I will also occasionally take multiple images of a scene at different exposure settings and then blend them manually with Photoshop after scanning.
</p>
<p>
I strive to produce images that closely match what an eye would view and mind would perceive. Achieving a balance between shadow detail and realistic rendering is often a challenge and I consider this an area where I will always be learning.
